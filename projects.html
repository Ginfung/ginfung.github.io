                        Émigré is a prototype game to teach the history of immigration to the United States.
                        The game currently follows Hind, and Lebanese immigrant at the turn of the 20th century,
                        making here way from Mount Lebanon, through Beirut, Marseilles, and eventually Ellis Island
                        to reach the United States. Along the way, she encounters challenges and friends, reflecting
                        the real-life stories of similar immigrants who have made the journey. The game focuses
                        on narrative to tell Hind's story, but weaves in resource management, exploration and
                        random events to keep the game interesting. The game is currently in a prototype phase, and
                        follows Hind only though the end of Beirut.

                        is a online, bock-based programming environment designed by researchers at UC Berkeley to make
                        programming more accessible to novices. The SnapLogging project extends Snap to include very
                        detailed logging of all student actions inside the environment. It supports logging to the console
                        or a database and can be easily extended to support more backends. The data can then be browsed online
                        to easily understand how students are completing assignments. Students can also be made to select
                        an assignment before beginning, allowing the collected data to be easily sorted.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The SnapLogging project is the groundwork for a larger project on data-driven hint generation in Snap.
                        Based on the data collected from students working on assignments in Snap, we can generate customized
                        hints for new students who may not know how to proceed. Check back in a few months for an update on this
                        work.

                        PlatForge is a an Android app that allows users to make, play and share games on their mobile phones and tablets.
                        The app was the product of my undergraduate honors thesis, in which I investigated the applications of game making for the purpose of learning STEM subjects.
                        The goal of PlatForge is not to teach STEM directly, but rather to expose students to concepts like vectors, 2D geometry and programming in a positive, informal setting.
                        This is done in the hope that some of those students will be more receptive to those same concepts when they encounter them in formal academic settings.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The app itself focuses on the 2D platformer genre and includes a built-in physics engine, menu-based scripting, character classes and a customizable UI.
                        It also comes with a set of art assets, from animated character sprites to tilling backgrounds, to allow users to dive right into the game making process.
                        PlatForge has tutorials to get users started, and its menu-based scripting is easy to pick up.
                        The art and code are both licensed under the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license, which means they're available for anyone to use in a non-commercial product.

                        Block-based visual programming languages, like Scratch, Alice, Blockly and SNAP! are becoming more popular for teaching novices how to code for the first time.
                        These languages replace the textual syntax of programming languages with drag-and-drop blocks or menus that eliminate syntax errors.
                        Intuitively, this should make programming easier for novices, but little research has been done to compare block languages with their textual counterparts.
                        <a href="http://homepages.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/~mwh/minigrace/tiled/" target="_blank">Tiled Grace</a>
                        is a programming environment that supports both textual and tiled programming, and even switching between the two.
                        It also gives us a great opportunity to isolate the effects of a block-based interface on novices.

                        Clashroom asks the question, "how can a serious game make learning more fun, regardless of the subject?"
                        The result is a videogame meant to augment classroom learning by adding game-like elements, with minimal effort on the part of the teacher.
                        Students take the role of a dragon trainer, in an RPG-style arena game.
                        Players can earn items and experience for their dragons by completing educational quests designed by the teacher.
                        Think of these quests as the kind of assignments a teacher might give as extra-credit to encourage more in-depth learning outside of the formal bounds of the syllabus.
                        For instance, a teacher might ask students to research an important figure in their discipline, or ask a librarian what resources are available.
                        Every week, players are assigned into balanced teams and pitted against each other to let players show off their dragons.

                            Netflix Prize competition was hold by Netflix Inc. in Oct 2006. The main goal of this competition was to predict how many score a user will rate for a movie, by learning a test set containing nearly 100 million customer rating records. In this project, we learned the data from this competition.<br>
                            Given the 100 million customer rating records, we focused on the following tasks:

                                <li>Predict the existed records by data analysis techniques (Decision tree, ANN, KNN, etc.). Compute the RMSE (Root mean squared error) of different model, and then compare them.</li>
                                <li>Forecast whether one customer will be in favor of one released movie.</li>
                                <li>Given essential information (directors, genres, casts, etc) of a movie, predict which group of customers will love it, and which group of customers will dislike it.</li>

Finally, we gave some examples to show the performance of our algorithm.

                            In the project, we try to improve the conformity of NURBS surfaces by an optimization algorithm using general bilinear transformations. Now we are verifying the correctness and the practicability of the algorithm. Finally we will develop some example to show the performance of the algorithm.

                            In this system, we first developed a model to express various kinds of roads, overpass or tunnel etc. in the city. Then we analyzed the real-time data collected from the system by the cellular automation model. In addition, we also developed an android app based on this system. The app won the Second Prize in <a href="http://china.ican-contest.org/index.html">International Contest of Applications in Network of Things (China) </a>2013.

                            In this interesting project, we tried to develop a music information retrieval system. We developed a model to “describe” the characteristic of the song. When the humming sound collected by an android app, we calculated the main characteristic of the sound and matched it from our database.

                            Clustering plays an increasingly important role in data mining and data analysis. We illustrated an improved clustering algorithm- K-means Algorithm, which can be accomplished much more easily and faster than many other similar algorithm.

                            This is my course design of Data Structure class. To begin this course design, I first studied the structure of B-Tree and the common operation upon it. Then I wrote a B-Tree using C++, analyzed the spatial complexity and time complexity of the B-Tree and its operation. Finally, I also compared this data structure with other similar data structure-B* Tree, B+ Tree
