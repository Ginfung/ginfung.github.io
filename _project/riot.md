This project introduces RIOT (Randomized Instance Order Types), a stochastic based method for <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/169199-data-science-workflow-overview-and-challenges/fulltext"><u>workflow</u></a> scheduling in the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/"><u>commercial cloud environment</u></a>. RIOT groups the tasks in the workflow into virtual machines via a probability model and then use a useful surrogate based method to assess the tremendous amount of potential schedulings. Experiments in dozens of study cases showed that RIOT executes tens of times faster than traditional methods while generating comparable results to other algorithms.
