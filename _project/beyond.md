Evolutionary algorithms typically require a large number of evaluations (of solutions) to converge â€“ which can be very slow and expensive to evaluate. To solve search-based software engineering (SE) problems, using fewer evaluations than evolutionary methods. Instead of mutating a small population, we build a very large initial population which is then culled using a recursive bi-clustering chop approach. We evaluate this approach on multiple SE models, unconstrained as well as constrained, and compare its performance with standard evolutionary algorithms.
