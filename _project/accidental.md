title:  "An (Accidental) Exploration of Alternatives to Evolutionary Algorithms for SBSE"
slug: "accidental"
---

SBSE researchers often use an evolutionary algorithm to solve various software engineering problems. This paper explores an alternate approach to sampling. This approach  finds the (near) optimal solutions to the problem by (i) creating a larger initial population and (ii) intelligently sampling the solution space to find the best subspace. Unlike evolutionary algorithms, it does not use mutation or cross-over or multi-generational reasoning to find interesting subspaces but relies on the underlying dimensions of the solution space. Experiments with Software Engineering (SE) models show that our performance improvement is competitive with standard MOEAs while, terminating over an order of magnitude faster.
