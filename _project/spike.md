title:  "Predicting Breakdowns in Cloud Services (with SPIKE)"
slug: "spike"
---
Maintaining web-services is a mission-critical task. Any downtime of web-based services means loss of revenue. Worse, such downtimes can damage the reputation of an organization as a reliable service provider (and in the current competitive web services market, such a loss of reputation causes extensive loss of future revenue). 

To address this issue, we developed SPIKE, a data mining tool which can predict upcoming service breakdowns, half an hour into the future. Such predictions let an organization alert and assemble the tiger team to address the problem (e.g. by reconfiguring cloud hardware in order to reduce the likelihood of that breakdown). 

This project was cooperated with LexisNexis Inc.
